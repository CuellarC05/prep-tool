    "End 30 seconds early to invite questions. Panelists love that."

  "pitch_variants": {
    "30sec": "We're studying how generative AI is reshaping hiring in our region. Through a 500-employer survey, 30 qualitative interviews, and a public AI Readiness Dashboard, we'll give workforce leaders the first real data on regional GenAI adoption — an $85K investment that positions our university as the go-to resource on AI and employment.",
    "60sec": "Generative AI is transforming how companies recruit and hire, but all the research focuses on big coastal metros. No one has studied what's happening in regions like ours. We propose a rigorous mixed-methods study: a 500-employer survey across 12 counties, 30 in-depth interviews with HR directors, and a public AI Readiness Dashboard. Three chambers of commerce are already on board. For $85,000 over 18 months, we'll deliver a peer-reviewed publication, a policy brief, and the region's first AI workforce readiness report. This is about equipping our community to navigate the AI transition with data, not assumptions.",
    "2min": "Thank you for your time. Let me tell you about a gap that's costing our region — not money, but insight.<br><br>Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are now embedded in hiring at major corporations. McKinsey reports 72% of large firms have adopted GenAI in some HR function. But here's the problem: <em>we have zero data on what's happening in mid-sized metros like ours.</em><br><br>Are local employers using AI to screen resumes? To write job descriptions? Are they skipping it entirely? We don't know — and neither do the workforce boards and economic development agencies making investment decisions for our region.<br><br>Our proposal fills this gap with three aims. First, we'll survey 500+ employers across 12 counties — we already have three chambers of commerce committed to recruitment. Second, we'll interview 30 HR directors in depth to understand not just 'if' but 'how' and 'why.' Third, we'll build a public AI Readiness Dashboard — interactive, open-access, and designed for policymakers.<br><br>The total cost is $85,000 over 18 months. Our team has the expertise, the partnerships, and the track record. This isn't just a research project — it's a public resource that positions our university as the regional authority on AI and workforce development.<br><br>I'd be happy to take any questions."

  "key_messages": [
    "First regional study of GenAI adoption in hiring — no comparable data exists",
    "Mixed methods: 500-employer survey + 30 in-depth interviews = rigorous evidence",
    "Public AI Readiness Dashboard — actionable, open-access, long-lived",

  "objections": [
    {
      "objection": "Isn't this research already being done at the national level?",
      "response": "National studies aggregate data that erases regional variation. A 72% adoption rate nationally could mean 90% in San Francisco and 20% here. Our study provides the granular, local data that actually informs regional policy."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How do you know employers will respond to the survey?",
      "response": "We have written commitments from three chambers of commerce to co-distribute the survey. My prior regional employer survey achieved a 38% response rate, well above the typical 15-20% for business surveys."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What's the sustainability plan for the dashboard after funding ends?",
      "response": "The dashboard will be hosted on university infrastructure at minimal cost. We're building it with open-source tools, and the Hibbs Institute has committed to maintaining it as a core public resource."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Why not just focus on the survey without the interviews?",
      "response": "Surveys tell us 'what' and 'how much,' but not 'why.' The qualitative interviews will reveal the motivations, barriers, and concerns behind adoption decisions — that's what makes policy recommendations credible."
