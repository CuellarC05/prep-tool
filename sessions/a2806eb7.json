That is the gap this project fills.\n\nFrom Programs to Payoffs is a 12-month applied research project. We use two data sources UT Tyler already has access to: JobsEQ for real-time job postings, and Steppingblocks for alumni outcomes. We apply NLP and machine learning to build a GenAI Adoption Index — not theoretical exposure, but actual employer adoption — and then use Difference-in-Differences and event study designs to measure how that adoption affects alumni earnings and careers, program by program.\n\nThree aims: build the index in months one through four, test the impact in months five through seven, and deliver the evidence in months eight through twelve.\n\nFour concrete deliverables. A reproducible GenAI Adoption Dataset, updatable every year. A journal-ready working paper. Program-level risk and opportunity briefs with a dashboard prototype. And an AUBER national conference presentation plus a UT Tyler campus panel with invited experts.\n\nThis is not just a research project. This is strategic intelligence. It tells a dean which programs face GenAI task substitution and which are positioned for complementarity. That is evidence you can act on tomorrow.\n\nOur team — Dr. Cecilia Cuellar and Dr. Manuel Reyes at the Hibbs Institute — has the expertise, the data access, and the track record. Total ask: $25,769. 44% of that directly supports UT Tyler students.\n\nBut here is the strategic play: this seed investment produces exactly the preliminary data, the published evidence, and the institutional partnerships that NSF, NEH, and the Mellon Foundation require for competitive proposals. We are talking about positioning UT Tyler for grants worth orders of magnitude more.\n\nSo the next time a student asks 'will my degree pay off?' — UT Tyler answers with data, not guesswork.\n\nThank you."

  "objections": [
    {
      "objection": "How is this different from what Eloundou et al. and other studies already show?",
      "response": "Eloundou and others measure theoretical exposure — what percentage of tasks could be affected by GPT. We measure actual adoption: what employers are requesting right now in real job postings. That's a fundamentally different signal. And critically, we connect it to program-level outcomes at a specific university. No one has done that. National averages don't help a UT Tyler dean plan their curriculum."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Can NLP reliably identify GenAI requirements in job postings?",
      "response": "Yes. The NLP pipeline builds on established computational linguistics methods for skill extraction from job postings. We're not inventing a new technique — we're applying proven methods to a new question. The index is validated against known benchmarks and the methodology is fully documented for reproducibility. This is also why we have the JobsEQ data budget — RTI provides structured posting data that makes classification more tractable."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Is 12 months realistic for this scope?",
      "response": "Absolutely. The timeline is sequential and focused: four months for index construction, three months for econometric analysis, and five months for deliverables and dissemination. We already have data access through institutional agreements. The team has the technical skills in place. And the RA hiring begins immediately. Each aim has a clear milestone, and we've built buffer into the translation phase."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Why should we fund this at UT Tyler rather than a larger research institution?",
      "response": "Three reasons. First, we have the institutional data access — both JobsEQ through the Hibbs Institute and Steppingblocks alumni outcomes. That's our unique advantage. Second, the Hibbs Institute has a track record of translating research into actionable community tools — not just academic papers. Third, this is about UT Tyler's own students and programs. The insights are most valuable to the institution that produced them."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What if the econometric results are inconclusive?",
      "response": "An inconclusive finding is still publishable and still valuable. It would mean GenAI adoption hasn't yet measurably impacted alumni outcomes — which is actionable intelligence for planning. But regardless of the causal results, the GenAI Adoption Index itself is a lasting data asset. The program briefs, the dashboard, and the panel all deliver value independent of the econometric estimates. We've designed the project so every phase produces something tangible."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How do you ensure the GenAI Adoption Index stays current after the project ends?",
      "response": "The index is built on a reproducible pipeline with documented code. JobsEQ data refreshes quarterly. Once the NLP classifier is trained, running it on new data is straightforward — a graduate RA can update it. This is not a one-time analysis; it's infrastructure. And that ongoing capability is exactly what makes our federal grant proposals competitive: we can demonstrate sustained capacity."
