    "30sec": "AI is transforming the workforce - 80% of American workers are in AI-exposed occupations, yet there are zero regional studies for East Texas. Our proposal creates the first Regional AI Exposure Index for the 23-county region, engages community stakeholders, and delivers actionable tools for workforce readiness. For under $100,000, we position UT Tyler as the regional leader in AI workforce research and build the foundation for millions in federal funding.",
    "60sec": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping the American workforce at an unprecedented pace. 80% of workers are in AI-exposed occupations. 19% are in highly exposed roles. In rural Texas, 21% of workers face high AI exposure. Yet there are zero regional studies examining what this means for East Texas communities.\n\nOur proposal - AI Exposure in East Texas - addresses this gap through three phases: first, we assess AI exposure across all occupations in the 23-county region. Second, we engage employers, educators, and workforce boards through community forums. Third, we deliver concrete tools: a Regional AI Exposure Index, a technical report, community forums, and a policy brief.\n\nLed by Dr. Cuellar and Dr. Reyes at the Hibbs Institute, this $99,960 investment produces the first regional AI workforce study for East Texas and positions UT Tyler for federal grants from NSF, DOL, and EDA worth 10 to 50 times this initial investment.",
    "2min": "Let me paint a picture for you. Right now, 80% of American workers are in occupations with tasks exposed to artificial intelligence. That is not a future prediction - that is today, according to research by Eloundou and colleagues at OpenAI. 19% of workers are in highly exposed roles. And in rural Texas, 21% of workers face high AI exposure.\n\nBut here is the critical gap: there are zero - literally zero - regional studies examining what AI means for East Texas workers, employers, and communities. National averages tell us the trend. They do not tell Tyler, Longview, or Nacogdoches what to do about it.\n\nThat is what this proposal addresses. AI Exposure in East Texas: Workforce Readiness for an AI-Driven Economy is a three-phase applied research project.\n\nFirst, we assess: we merge federal O*NET occupational data with local BLS and Census statistics to create a Regional AI Exposure Index - the first of its kind for our 23-county region. This index maps exactly which occupations, industries, and communities are most affected.\n\nSecond, we engage: we host community forums bringing together employers, educators, workforce development boards, and local leaders. This is not a report that sits on a shelf. We co-create strategies with the people who will implement them.\n\nThird, we deliver: four concrete outputs. The AI Exposure Index as an interactive tool. A comprehensive technical report. Documented community forum proceedings. And a policy brief for legislators and workforce boards.\n\nOur team at the Hibbs Institute - Dr. Cecilia Cuellar as PI and Dr. Manuel Reyes as Co-PI - brings deep expertise in regional economic analysis and community engagement. We have the relationships, the data infrastructure, and the track record.\n\nThe total investment: $99,960, with 92% going directly to research and engagement. But here is why this is strategic: this project produces exactly the preliminary data and community partnerships that federal agencies like NSF, DOL, and EDA require for major grants. We are talking about positioning UT Tyler for 10 to 50 times this investment in federal funding.\n\nFor under $100,000, we become the regional authority on AI workforce readiness. We give our communities the data they need. And we build a launchpad for the future. Thank you."

      "objection": "Why should UT Tyler lead this rather than a larger institution?",
      "response": "The Hibbs Institute has deep roots in the East Texas community. We have existing relationships with workforce boards, employers, and local leaders that larger institutions lack. Our track record - published reports on childcare, workforce development, and economic indicators - demonstrates our capability. Being embedded in the region is our strategic advantage."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Is $99,960 enough to produce meaningful results?",
      "response": "Absolutely. 92% goes directly to research and engagement. The assessment leverages existing federal datasets (O*NET, BLS, Census) - we are not collecting primary data from scratch. The budget is lean and focused. And the real value is strategic: this pilot produces the preliminary findings needed to compete for federal grants worth 10-50x this amount."
    },
    {
      "objection": "AI is changing so fast - won't this research be outdated quickly?",
      "response": "That is precisely why we need a baseline now. The AI Exposure Index is designed as a living tool that can be updated annually as new O*NET data is released. The methodology we establish becomes a reusable framework. And the community partnerships we build endure beyond any single report."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How is this different from national AI workforce studies?",
      "response": "National studies give us averages. They tell us 80% of workers are affected nationally, but they do not map which specific occupations in Tyler or Longview are most at risk. Our Regional AI Exposure Index provides county-level, occupation-level specificity that does not exist anywhere. Local workforce boards cannot plan with national averages."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What if the community forums do not produce meaningful input?",
      "response": "We have experience running successful community engagement through the Hibbs Institute. The forums are structured with data presentations followed by facilitated discussion. We are not asking people to speculate - we are showing them specific data about their community and asking how to act on it. That combination of evidence plus local knowledge consistently produces actionable insights."
